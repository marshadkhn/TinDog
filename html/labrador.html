                    The Labrador breed dates back to at least the 
                    1830s, when St. John's water dogs bred by European 
                    settlers in Newfoundland were first introduced to Britain 
                    from ships trading between Canada and Poole in Dorset. 
                    These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create 
                    what became known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons 
                    included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch, the 
                    Earl of Home, and Sir John Scott.
