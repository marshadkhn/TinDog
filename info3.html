          <p>
            Pit bull-type dogs have a controversial reputation as pets both in
            the United States and internationally, due to their history in dog
            fighting, the number of high-profile attacks documented in the
            media over decades, and their proclivity to latching on while
            biting. Proponents of the type and advocates of regulation have
            engaged in a nature-versus-nurture debate over whether apparent
            aggressive tendencies in pit bulls may be appropriately attributed
            to owners' care for the dog or inherent qualities.
