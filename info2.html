            The Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. John's
            water dogs bred by European settlers in Newfoundland were first
            introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and Poole in
            Dorset. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create
            what became known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons
            included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of
            Home, and Sir John Scott.
